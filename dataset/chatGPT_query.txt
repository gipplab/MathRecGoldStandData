Q: Are you familiar with the zbMATH Open database and can you give publication recommendations based on the document IDs?
A: Yes, I'm familiar with the zbMATH Open database. It is a comprehensive, free database containing information on mathematical publications, authors, and citations. It is maintained by FIZ Karlsruhe and the Berlin State Library, with contributions from many mathematicians and institutions worldwide.

Although I cannot directly access the zbMATH Open database to provide you with specific publication recommendations based on document IDs, I can help you find related publications or topics if you provide the title, author, or keywords of the document in question. Additionally, you can visit the zbMATH Open website (https://zbmath.org/) to search for publications or browse their classification system.

If you let me know the area of mathematics you're interested in or provide more information about the document you have in mind, I can help guide you to relevant resources or recommend similar publications.


====================================================

Q: I will provide you documents with Zbl IDs in parentheses and abstracts/reviews/summaries. Please provide 10 recommendations for each of the documents. Only show recommendations that have a Zbl number which means give recommendations from zbMATH Open only. Gnerate recommendations based on semantic similarity of abstracts/reviews/summaries. The result list should be a JSON format and only contains the Zbl numbers of the recommendations. 

Document A (Zbl: 0940.14001): Let \(X\) be a smooth complex projective variety, and let \(\text{CH}^k(X,1)\) be the higher Chow group. A higher Chow cycle is said to be decomposable if it lies in the image of the intersection product, i.e., the group of decomposable higher Chow cycles is 
\[
\text{CH}^k_{\text{dec}}(X,1)= \text{Im} \{\text{CH}^1(X,1) \otimes\text{CH}^{k-1}(X,1) \to\text{CH}^k (X, 1)\},
\]
 and the group of indecomposable cycles is the quotient 
\[
\text{CH}^k_{ \text{ind}}(X,1;\mathbb{Q})= (\text{CH}^k (X,1)/ \text{CH}^k_{\text{dec}} (X,1))\otimes\mathbb{Q}.
\]
The first major result of this paper is the following: When \(X=E_1\times E_2\) is a sufficiently general product of two elliptic curves, then \(\text{CH}^k_{\text{ind}}(X,1; \mathbb{Q})\neq \{0\}\). The second one, which has a similar flavor to Mumford's famous theorem on the kernel of the Albanese map on the Chow group of zero-cycles on a surface of positive genus: When \(X=E_1 \times E_2\times E_3\) is a sufficiently general product of three elliptic curves, the kernel of the cycle class map \(c_{3,1}:\text{CH}^3(X,1; \mathbb{Q})\to H^5_{\mathcal D}(X, \mathbb{Q}(k))\) into Deligne cohomology is uncountable.
